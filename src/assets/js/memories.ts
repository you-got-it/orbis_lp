      "Letting your children go, when its their time to start school, is an emotional rollercoaster.  Pride, excitement, loneliness, sadness your time together, in their little years, is over.  This morning my girls - aged 7 and 4 - took each others hands and walked all the way from the gate, through the entrance, down the steps and to the reception classroom, without once letting go of each other's hands.  They smiled at each other, and chatted all the way.  It was magical and heart warming to watch.",
